# Edge

From "Datum edge". Also represents the 'edge' of our current thinking
on the baseline architecture of Clojure projects. It contains
architectural patterns for the rapid construction of robust and
flexible systems.

## Features

Edge is a simple project demonstrating the following:

### Front-end

- boot powered
- sass

### API server

- [A Stuart Sierra component reloaded project](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component)
- Use of `schema.core/defrecord` to validate your system's integrity on every reset
- Run all your tests with `(run-all-tests)`
- bidi & yada for serving web resources and APIs

## Getting started

### Front-end

Edit the sass files in sass

```
boot dev
```

## Infrastructure

```
lein repl
(dev)
(go)
(reset-and-test)
```

## Libraries


## A recommended pattern for constructing systems

In order to enjoy the most flexibility from SScomp, we offer the following rules

1. Declare dependencies (using `component/using`) in the components
   themselves - it's the component that knows it needs something,
   that's the perfect place to declare that need!

1. Use simple (non-namespaced) keywords to denote dependencies in components

1. Declare the components in system.clj using namespaced keys

This scheme will allow your system to expand. It allows you to use
components multiple times in the same system, rather than be tied to a
singleton model. It ensures that when you do this, you won't be bogged
down in keyword clashes.

## A boot-driven ClojureScript dev and prod environment

```
boot dev
